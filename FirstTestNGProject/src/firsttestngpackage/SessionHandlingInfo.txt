Why do we need Session Handling?
During test execution, the Selenium WebDriver has to interact with the browser all the time 
to execute given commands. At the time of execution, it is also possible that, before current execution completes,
someone else starts execution of another script, in the same machine and in the same type of browser.

How to achieve Session Handling in Selenium WebDriver?
If you check the source code of Selenium WebDriver, you will find a variable named as 'sessionId'. 
Whenever we create a new instance of a WebDriver object,
a new 'sessionId' will be generated and attached with that particular Firefox/Chrome/IE Driver ().
So anything we do after this will execute only in that particular Firefox browser session.
