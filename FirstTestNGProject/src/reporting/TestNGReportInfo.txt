There can be two ways we can customize TestNG report

Using ITestListener Interface:We use this interface when we need to customize real time report. 
In other words, if we are executing the bunch of test cases in a TetNG suite and we want to get 
the report of each test case, then after each test case we need to implement ITestListener interface.
 This interface will override onTestFailure, onTestStart, 
onTestSkipped method to send the correct status of the current test case.


Using IReporter Interface:If we want to customize final test report generated by TestNG,
we need to implement IReporter interface. This interface has only one method to implement generateReport. 
This method has all the information of a complete test execution in the List<ISuite>, 
and we can generate the report using it.
